            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                8-Puzzle Search is a lightweight, easy to use project developed to share a simple
                implementation of a <b>bidirectional A* search</b> algorithm. 
                The project is coded using only client web technologies
                such as <b>Javascript</b> and it doesn't require a server to elaborate data.
            </p>
            <p>
                An 8-Puzzle is game consisting of a $3 \times 3$ grid containing one empty space and eight moving tiles, 
                each numbered from $1$ to $8$.
                The aim of the game is to move the tiles into different positions using the empty space
                to reach a grid configuration in which the tiles are ordered.

            <h3>The 8-Puzzle problem</h3>
            <p>
                An 8-Puzzle tiles configuration can be called <b>state</b>. In a $3 \times 3$ space one could calculate
                $9! = 362880$ possible configurations, but one can only reach half i.e. $9!/2 = 181440$ of the possible
                states starting from one initial configuration and considering the constraint of moving the tiles
                using only the empty space.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, a <b>valid initial state</b> is obteined by randomly moving the tiles starting from 
                the <b>goal state</b>.
                A <b>valid move</b> consists in swapping the position of two vertically or horizzontally adjacent squares if 
                one of them is empty.
                One can choose a number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and execute $n$ random valid moves starting from the goal state
                avoiding to reach the same state more than one time within the execution (if no valid moves can be 
                executed, the process is interrupted).
            </p>

            <h3>The searching algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                The 8-Puzzle problem belongs to a class of problems that could be solved using search. 
                The <b>solution</b> is a list of moves that allow to reach the goal state from the initial state.
                This particular problem can be solved using a <b>bidirectional search algorithm</b>.
                Since the search algorithm could be applied to go from a generic state $S_1$ to a another state $S_2$,
                it could also be applied backwards starting from $S_2$ and attaining $S_1$.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing the bidirectional search algorithm, two solvers will apply a forward search from $S_1$ to
                $S_2$ and a backward search from $S_2$ to $S_1$ respectively.
                These two solvers will reach the same intermediate state $S_m$ and the combination of the path produced
                will be elaborated to form the solution.

            <p>
                The advantages of using a bidirectional search algorithm instead of a <i>standard</i> search algorithm 
                is to considerably reduce the computational resources needed to solve the problem. More technical details 
                can be found in the <b>related project</b> section of the <a href="../index.html">project page</a>.
